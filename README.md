# Carpooling Platform (cool name TBD)

## Resources

Here are some general resources that would be helpful for development.

- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) initialized this project for us. We should follow their recommendations for our project.
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) has everything you need for basic web development. If you have any HTML, CSS, Javascript questions, this is a great place to look. They also have a [CSS cookbook](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook) which describes how to achieve common layout patterns in CSS.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is the backend framework that we will be using.
- Progressive Web Apps
    - [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) has specific recommendations for PWAs.
    - [web.dev](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) goes into more detail about things specific to PWAs.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is our testing framework.

## How to run/test/build

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
